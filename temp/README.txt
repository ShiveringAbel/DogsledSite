multiple song music player by adilene @ adilene.net. free to use and edit as you like! credit is not necessary, but it is appreciated! <3

there are three files in this zip: 
- musicplayer(new).html 
- musicplayer(lite).html
- musicplayer(old).html
 
if you do not have neocities supporter, you MUST use the musicplayer(lite).html file. otherwise, your buttons will NOT show up. this is due to a stricter content security policy neocities implemented. this means that many scripts hosted on other sites MAY NOT work.
 
the musicplayer(old).html is the oldest version of the music player, included in this zip file in case you want to use it. 

if you aren't hosting your site on neocities or have neocities supporter, feel free to use whichever file suits your needs.

if you need any help feel free to reach out to me at adilene.net!
